# PUTMOP

PUTMOP ("Putmop Updates The Memory Of Putmop") is a friendly
rogue-like ascii game where the game world contains almost all of the working
memory of the game, which the player can update and manipulate.

The main objective (apart from trying to have fun
playing this game) is to exit the game gracefully, thus, if
the program segfaults, you lose.

The world is also populated with other bots,
unknowing of the perils of C's undefined behavior.

Upon each start the game world is randomized, so
the placement of the different parts of
game data is random, and the bots program's are
also random.

This game is far from finished...

## Future work

* Implement the rest of the bot's commands
* Add a high-score based on the sum of the
  cell-wise diff between the original world and the current world
  upon graceful exit. So more cells edited gives a higher score.
* Make more TODOs so it looks like the game is far from finished.
* Add the TODOs from the previous point to this list.
* Do all the TODOs in this list.
* Remove the TODOs that have been done.
